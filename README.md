Artmix v 0.1
======

A simple and secure MP3 visualization writing in JavaScript and CSS.
Artmix has no dependencies and shouldn't conflict with libraries like jQuery

Install:
	1. Put the /artmix directory on your site.
	2. On the page where you're going to install Artmix, add the following to the <head> (adjusting the path if necessary)
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="artmix/css/artmix.css" />
		<script src="artmix/js/config.js"></script>
		<script src="artmix/js/artmix.js"></script>
	3. On the page where you're going to install Artmix, add an empty div#artmix (this is where the action is)
		<div id="artmix"></div>
	4. When you've entered all the Settings and LinesAndTimes click "Download" and save the popup to config.js
		Don't reload without saving this file! Artmix doesn't have autosave or access to your drives on the client or server

	When you load the page you should see a black square in a gray box in the upper left corner.
	Clicking on this will open the interface.
	If you don't see the black square then maybe "editmode":false in config.js
